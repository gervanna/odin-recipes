        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Remove the skin (if there is any) from the chicken and cut it into small pieces. Wash the chicken in water with the juice from the lime/lemon and the vinegar. Drain away all the excess water from the chicken. Dry with a paper towel if necessary.</li>
            <li>In a kitchen bowl, add the chicken, onion, garlic, scotch bonnet pepper, pimento berries, ginger, salt, all-purpose seasoning, the curry powder and mix everything together and leave to marinate for 30 minutes or more.</li>
            <li>In a pot add the cooking oil and put it on medium heat.</li>
            <li>Add the seasoned chicken to the oil and stir well. Let the chicken cook until lightly brown on all sides. Don't let the pot burn, add a tip of water if necessary.</li>
            <li>Stir in the carrot, potato and thyme. Add enough water to cover the chicken in the pot. Cover and leave to cook for 25-30 minutes, until the chicken is cooked and the water is reduced to a curry gravy.</li>
        </ol>
